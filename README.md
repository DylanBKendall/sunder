# Sunder: Survivors of the Divide

*An interactive narrative experience built in Twine*

> How much can you change before you’re no longer yourself?

## Overview

**Sunder: Survivors of the Divide** is a narrative-driven interactive story set in a dystopian sci-fi world shaped by an aging, unstable sun.  
The project explores survival, identity, and technological augmentation through branching choices, persistent consequences, and multiple endings.

You play as **Lorien**, a lone traveler crossing a hostile wasteland to lay a loved one’s ashes to rest — a journey that forces you to decide not just *how* to survive, but *who you become*.

## Design Goals

This project prioritizes narrative systems over exposition:

- World rules are implied, not explained
- Consequences matter more than optimal choices
- Knowledge persists across playthroughs, even when the world resets
- The story asks the player to *live with outcomes*, not undo them

The full design philosophy and franchise vision are documented in the Narrative Design Document.
